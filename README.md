# Fraud-Detection-Credit-Card

# Problem Statment
Objective: The goal is to build a supervised classification model to detect fraudulent transactions based on the provided credit card dataset. The key metrics to evaluate the model will be Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

# Project Summary

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the fraud detection.

# Summary

Problem: Classifying credit card transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

Data: Anonymized dataset with credit card transaction data.

EDA Insights : The dataset is highly imbalanced, with far fewer fraud cases than non-fraud cases.

Correlation analysis showed no strong linear relationship between features and the target.
